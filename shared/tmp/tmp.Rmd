```
```{r}
#factorize all binary variables
bincols<-colMeans((ds_icu_pm_1==1| ds_icu_pm_1==0),na.rm=T)==1
for (i in 1:length(bincols)) {
  #turn the binary column as a factor
  if (bincols[i]){
    ds_icu_pm_1[[i]]<-as.factor(ds_icu_pm_1[[i]])
  }
}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
